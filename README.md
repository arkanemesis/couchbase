These are Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates that install Couchbase Enterprise.  [simple](simple) is probably the best starting point.  [generator](generator) is a template generator for advanced configurations, including MDS and XDCR.

[marketplace](marketplace) is the template used in the [Couchbase Azure Marketplace offers](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/couchbase.couchbase-enterprise) and probably best deployed directly from Marketplace.  Similarly [testdrive](testdrive) supports the Azure Marketplace offer and shouldn't be used standalone.

Documentation that covers deploying from Marketplace as well as some best practices is available [here](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/cloud/couchbase-azure.html).
